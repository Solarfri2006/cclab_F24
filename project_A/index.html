                Our planet's oceans were becoming increasingly polluted with its acidification process intensifying and marine litter overflowing. Confronted with this senario, a group of Avant-garde scientists turned to developing bioprobes as alternatives for traditional probes. Their idea was to integrate different species' evolutionary advantages and high-tech to create probes with comprehensive functionality.
                Neon Glowlet is an owlet whose gene has been modified to include certain gene segments extracted from deep-sea jellyfish, allowing it to possess some jellyfish traits along with its own owl traits, such as being able to morph into a kaleidoscope of colors.In addition to its powerful recombinant genes, it is also equipped with a high-tech microchip, allowing it to function as a highly efficient probe accustomed to deep-sea surroundings.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature:</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>When there's no movement from the audience, Neon glides around on its own accord.</li>
                    <li>Dragging the mouse continuously simulates Neon tracking something underwater (it follows the mouse smoothly).</li>
                    <li>Pressing any key would generate a random piece of debris in the water, after which Neon will swoop over and eat it.</li>
